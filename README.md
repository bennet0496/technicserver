This Project aims to provide an simple wrapper for Minecraft Modpack Servers for Modpacks at technicpack.net. You only need to provide the Technicpack-API link and the technicserver will download the Modpack and convert it to a Minecraft Server. Both single ZIP-File Modpacks and Modpacks using the [Solder-API](http://solder.io/) (which in my opinion is the preferred Method of hosting Modpacks :smile:) are supported

Currently you can **only** run Modpacks using the Forge Modloader. 

You are only able to use this Software with shared Gameserver Hosters, if they support custom Minecraft JAR-File, Custom Java Commandlines and if they allow running two Java Processes simultaneously. The Wrapper adds an Runtime Overhead of about 200MB RAM.
