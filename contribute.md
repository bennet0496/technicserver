# Bug report
**Before** reporting a bug, please try make sure this is a bug by caused **this** wrapper. Please do not submit bugs of the Modpack it self, Minecraft or the Technic API. This counts also and even more the other way around, do not submit Wrapper Bugs to the Modpack Creator, Mojang AB or Syndicate LLC.  
Now that we have clearified this :sweat_smile: and you are sure that this a bug of this project we can continue on how to submit a bug:
  * If you have a Github Account, please head over to the [Github Isses Page](https://github.com/bennet0496/technicserver/issues), otherwise you can use this Formular https://gitreports.com/issue/bennet0496/technicserver
  * In your report try to be as accurate as possible to reproduce the bug, but you can spare out this that are not relevant (nobody wants to read a wall of text). But include at least the following:
    *  A detailed description on how to reproduce the bug (as already mentiont)
    * Logs and/or commandline output corresponding to the Bug
    * The Operation System (as accurate as possible) you tried to run it on (e.g. `Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Linux 4.10.0-21-generic #23-Ubuntu SMP Fri Apr 28 16:14:22 UTC 2017 x86_64 GNU/Linux` or `Windows 10 Pro 1703 Build 15063.40`)
    * The used Java Version (as accurate as possible. e.g. `java version "1.8.0_121" - Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13) - Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)`)
    * If Modpack specific, than the Modpack URL and Minecraft Version

# Feature Request
You found your self missing a feature, than feel free to share this. To do so follow this simple steps:
  * If you have a Github Account, please head over to the [Github Isses Page](https://github.com/bennet0496/technicserver/issues), otherwise you can use this Formular https://gitreports.com/issue/bennet0496/technicserver
  * Use `[Feature Request]` as the titles prefix
  * describe the desired feature as accurate as possible
  * wait while I (maybe) implement the feature :grin:

# Contribute Code
You found your self missing a feature but can't wait that it get implement or just wan't implement it your self and share it with me and the community. Than feel free to fork this Repo, implement the feature and create a [Github Pull Requst agains technicserver](https://github.com/bennet0496/technicserver/pulls). But while doing so please keep a few things in mind:
  * Before starting, I recommend to head over to the Issues Page and no one else is already working on this and maybe create a feature request to avoid duplicates.
  * While writing code please follow this Basic Coding Convension (I know it's not easy but it will help others to understand)
    * Use speaking Variable/Method/Class identifiers (Hungarian notation or similar is **not** necessary)
    * some basic commentary inside Methods would be nice, but javadoc comments are mandatory
    * Use spaces instead of tabs for indentation. 4 spaces for one level is optimal
    * Avoid "Spaghetti-"/"Ravioli-"/"Lasagna-" code, even if the code base already contains some :grin::sweat_smile:
  * Your commits have to be atomic. This means 1 Feature per Commit and ~1 Commit per Feature. (Which also reflect to the Pull Request it self. **1 Feature per Pull Request**)
  * Provide a detailed explaination what you implemented and what it impacts
  * If necessary please also include the user-/technical documentation (changes)
