This Project aims to provide an simple wrapper for Minecraft Modpack Servers for Modpacks at technicpack.net. You only need to provide the Technicpack-API link and the technicserver will download the Modpack and convert it to a Minecraft Server. Both single ZIP-File Modpacks and Modpacks using the [Solder-API](http://solder.io/) (which in my opinion is the preferred Method of hosting Modpacks ðŸ˜€) are supported

Currently you can **only** run Modpacks using the Forge Modloader. 

You are only able to use this Software with shared Gameserver Hosters, if they support custom Minecraft JAR-File, Custom Java Commandlines and if they allow running two Java Processes simultaneously. The Wrapper adds an Runtime Overhead of about 200MB RAM.



## Quick start

* Download the current Release form the Github Releases Page https://github.com/bennet0496/technicserver/releases

* Place the JAR-File in the Folder you want to install and run your Server

* Create a File called `modpack.properties` (or start the jar. it will create a skeleton and exit with an error) with at least the following content

  ```properties
  url=http://api.technicpack.net/modpack/your-modpack
  build=latest

  ```

  Replace the `url=...` with the API Url to the desired Modpack. You'll find the API Url by clicking `Install This Modpack` on the Modpack Page

* Start the Server with `java -jar technicserver.jar`
